# ðŸš€ Advanced Multiple Linear Regression for Investment Banking

Welcome to an innovative project that leverages **Multiple Linear Regression** to deliver actionable financial insights. This repository demonstrates two powerful methodsâ€”**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** and **Gradient Descent**â€”to model and forecast key financial metrics. The results are tailored for C-suite executives who demand clarity, precision, and strategic foresight.

## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s fast-paced financial markets, **data-driven decision-making** is the cornerstone of success. This project provides:
- **Advanced Predictive Modeling:** Using both OLS and Gradient Descent.
- **Synthetic Financial Data:** Simulated dataset with 2,000 rows and 10 features to mimic real-world indicators.
- **Visual and Quantitative Insights:** Clear metrics and graphs to support executive-level strategy.

## Key Features

- **Dual Implementation:**
  - **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS):** Closed-form solution for precise, interpretable modeling.
  - **Gradient Descent:** Iterative optimization suitable for large-scale data.
- **Robust Synthetic Dataset:** Reflects realistic financial scenarios.
- **Clear Performance Metrics:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) and convergence graphs.
- **Easy Integration:** A modular design ready to be extended with real-world financial data.
